# Dog-Vision
This TensorFlow-based machine learning project leverages transfer learning to classify dog breeds. By fine-tuning pre-trained models, it identifies canine breeds based on the given data.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow
* TensorFlow Hub

### Instructions
* Clone the repository.
`git clone https://github.com/iamharshvardhan/Dog-Vision.git`
* Open the dog-vision.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the deep-learning model.

### Results
The deep learning model we have used is (`Sequential`) with (`imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification`) architecture.
